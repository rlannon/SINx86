# SIN Documentation

_Note: these features are in ongoing development, and, as such, may not be fully-supported._

## Compiler Flags

The goal of this compiler is to support two different 'flavors' of SIN with a few different control settings. These features can be configured for each compilation by using different compiler flags. This document is to serve as an overview for the various compiler options and the available flags.

### Supported Flavors

There are two flavors of SIN that will be targeted by this compiler; standard SIN and micro-SIN (uSIN).

#### Standard SIN

Standard SIN is the default flavor and requires no special flags.

The documentation in this project covers aspects of _Standard SIN._ This is the regular flavor that offers all of the documented features.

#### uSIN

Use of uSIN can be enabled with the `--micro` flag.

uSIN is very similar to Standard SIN, but it comes with one significant caveat: it is assumed that no runtime environment is present, meaning an executable can be made without any external libraries. The idea behind its use is for low-level environments with little, if any, higher system functionality. This comes with a few significant feature limitations:

* dynamic types are not permitted, as there is no dynamic memory allocation mechanism present; and
* runtime error functions and codes (such as SINL_RTE_OUT_OF_BOUNDS) are not present, meaning the code generated by uSIN is inherently less safe.

Because of its extreme limitations, uSIN is better-suited than Standard SIN for applications like kernel development. Note that I am not suggesting uSIN would be a particularly good choice for such an endeavor.

### Supported Strictness Settings

SIN supports three settings for the strictness of the compiler.

* **Strict Mode** (`--use-strict`): The compiler treats all warnings as errors.
* **Normal Mode** (no flag): The compiler allows most warnings to compile, but does not allow what it considers "unsafe operations" such as inline assembly.
* **Lax Mode** (`--use-lax`): The compiler allows all warnings to compile, warning about (but compiling) unsafe behaviors.

### General Compilation Flags

Since this compiler does not link or assemble its output, its flags are more limited in functionality than, for example, GCC. However, it still supports a few options:

* **Help options:** As with any good program, this compiler supports help options. You may use `-h` or `--help` for general help, or in combination with another flag for help about that specific flag.
