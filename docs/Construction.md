## Type Construction

Because SIN does not allow for struct methods, an interesting problem arises, one that is present in C. Unlike, for example, Java, where default constructors are automatically generated by the compiler (if no other constructor is available), the SIN compiler does not provide any such method because _no_ methods exist for _any_ struct. This means that if a struct is allocated, and only some of its members are initialized, the struct itself will have been seen as initialized in the compiler when some of its fields may not have been. As an example, take the following example where we initialize some struct `point`, with integer members `x, y, z`:

    alloc point p;
    let p.x = 10;
    alloc int n: p.y;

In this case, the compiler will allow the use of `p.y` because it will consider the struct `p` as having been initialized -- it is not required to track every individual member. However, it is obvious that `p.y` will really be uninitialized. To solve this problem, SIN utilizes _type construction_ and allows for a Rust-like construction to be specified when a struct is allocated.

So, in the above example, we could say:

    alloc point p: construct point {
        x: 10,
        y: 0,
    };

Like in Rust, the `construct` expression must initialize _every_ member. There are three scenarios where the `construct` keyword may be used:

* Initialization with alloc-init syntax
* Struct replacement (whole struct assignment)
* Anonymous struct creation
