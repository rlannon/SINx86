# SINx86

This repository contains an updated toolchain for SIN targeting x86-64 systems. This is an updated/refactored/improved version of the repository [`SIN-Language`](http://github.com/rlannon/SIN-Language), a compiler project that targeted a 16-bit VM. While this changes the compiler target, it also includes significant updates and improvements to elements that it retained from the original, particularly the lexer and parser.

SIN is a custom procedural programming language based on C, C++, and Python, designed as an exercise in compiler design. It is named after the Spanish word meaning "without" because if anyone were to ask you about the language, you would reply that it is without any real utility or purpose. This repository contains a compiler for SIN with an x86 target; while I may add other architectures as I go on, x86 is the sole focus of the project for the time being.

## Goal of the Project

I cannot stress enough that this is a *learning exercise,* not an attempt at creating the next Python or Rust. This project is a hands-on way of learning compiler development. The purpose is not to create a particularly good compiler, but rather to serve as an exercise in compiler design and implementation. I intend on producing a *functioning* compiler, one that can be improved and expanded upon in the future.

## Getting Started

### Installation / Build

There are currently no working binaries for the toolchain; you must compile and build it yourself (an admittedly bad makefile is included). Note that this program is written to generate code for Linux on an x86-64 machine, and so it there is no guarantee that this compiler will generate usable programs on other platforms (for the time being). However, the Linux-specific runtime code for the language (interaction with an ABI) is being moved to the [runtime environment](https://github.com/rlannon/SRE), and so there shouldn't be any major compatibility issues with the code generated by this compiler, provided the code is being run on an x64 machine.

### The SRE

In order to compile working SIN binaries, you will need a copy of the [SIN Runtime Environment](https://github.com/rlannon/SRE), a small library which provides necessary runtime support for the language. Currently, the library is unfinished and so any compiled SIN programs will fail at the link stage.

### Third-Party Software

This is not a full compiler suite, and as such, a few third-party applications are required. Without them, the compiler will be not be able to generate working binaries for the programs you write. The required programs are:

* A working C compiler (such as GCC) - the compiler relies on certain C standard functions for things like memory allocation, so a C compiler with the standard library is necessary
* An assembler (NASM is recommended) - the compiler does not generate object code directly; instead, it generates x64 assembly in Intel syntax, meaning an assembler is required. While I prefer NASM, any assembler that supports Intel x86 syntax should work without too much difficulty

### Using SIN

I intend on using [GitHub Pages](rlannon.github.com/SIN) for introductory programming materials. Note that currently, not everything is up-to-date, and the site will be updated periodically.

## Future Goals

I hope to use this project as a stepping stone to develop other languages and explore other features, such as compilers for object-oriented programming languages. For this project specifically, I hope to add in:

* Various compiler optimizations
* Debugging support
* VSCode integration
* Native support for UTF-8 instead of ASCII
